# Road-Accident-Dashboard-in-Tableu

Introduction:
Road accidents pose a significant threat to public safety, causing immense loss of life and property worldwide. Understanding the patterns and trends of road accidents is crucial for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and individuals alike to implement effective measures for prevention and mitigation. In this analysis, we delve into the Road Accident Dashboard created using Tableau, aiming to unearth insights and trends that can inform decision-making and promote road safety initiatives.

## SOFTWARES USED
* Microsoft Excel
* Tableu

## Datasource:
The dataset used in this project is about road accident casualties in UK in year 2021 and 2022.
* [Road Accidents Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XQkfr5cs72lWv6E-1fBwiN1KuAnT-ifMw50j2RgDaHI/edit?usp=sharing) containing 14 columns and 660,680 rows, with a total of 9,230,099 records of observation.

## Dashboard Overview:
The Road Accident Dashboard presents a comprehensive view of various aspects related to road accidents, including geographical distribution, time trends, severity, and contributing factors. It integrates data visualization techniques to provide users with an intuitive interface for exploring and understanding complex accident data.
### Dashboard Visualization

## Key Findings:

1. Geographical Distribution:

•	The dashboard reveals the geographical distribution of road accidents across different regions. By analyzing this data, stakeholders can identify hotspots and allocate resources for targeted interventions.
•	Heat maps and geographical overlays provide a visual representation of accident-prone areas, facilitating informed decision-making for urban planning and infrastructure development.

2. Temporal Analysis:

•	Time series analysis enables users to examine trends in road accidents over specific time periods, such as daily, monthly, or yearly.
•	Identifying temporal patterns can aid in scheduling law enforcement patrols, implementing traffic management strategies, and conducting public awareness campaigns during high-risk periods.

3. Severity Analysis:

•	The dashboard allows users to analyze the severity of road accidents, categorized based on factors such as fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
•	Understanding the distribution of accident severity can guide resource allocation for emergency response services and medical facilities.

4. Contributing Factors:

•	Exploring contributing factors such as weather conditions, road conditions, and driver behavior sheds light on the root causes of road accidents.
•	By identifying prevalent contributing factors, policymakers can formulate targeted interventions, such as improving road maintenance or implementing stricter enforcement of traffic regulations.

## Recommendations and Implications:
Based on the insights derived from the Road Accident Dashboard, several recommendations can be proposed to enhance road safety:

1. Implement targeted interventions in accident hotspots identified through geographical analysis.
2. Strengthen enforcement measures targeting high-risk behaviors identified in contributing factor analysis.
3. Enhance road infrastructure and maintenance in areas prone to accidents.
4. Conduct public awareness campaigns focused on mitigating specific contributing factors, such as driving under adverse weather conditions or distracted driving.

## Conclusion:
The Road Accident Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders involved in road safety initiatives, offering actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis. By leveraging the power of Tableau visualization, this analysis contributes to the ongoing efforts to reduce the incidence and severity of road accidents, ultimately saving lives and safeguarding communities.
